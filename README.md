## Installation

If you still want to install on your own computer;

1. Clone the Github repository
2. Open a terminal and run 'npm start' to start your local server
3. Follow the 'localhost:3001' link in the terminal to navigate to the deployed page and start taking notes!

## Usage

This application requires each note to have a title and description before it can be saved.
Once this criteria is met, a 'save' icon will appear in the top right corner to save your note.
Once saved, notes are moved to the left column and can be viewed again, or deleted using the red trashcan icon.
